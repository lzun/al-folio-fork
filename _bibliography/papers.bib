  abstract = {In this work, we compare the performance of a machine learning framework based on a support vector machine (SVM) with fastText embeddings, and a Deep Learning framework consisting on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), DistilBERT, and Twitter roBERTa Base, to automate the classification of text data to analyze the country image of Mexico in selected data sources, which is described using 18 different classes, based in International Relations theory. To train each model, a data set consisting of tweets from relevant selected Twitter accounts and news headlines from The New York Times is used, based on an initial manual classification of all the entries. However, the data set presents issues in the form of imbalanced classes and few data. Thus, a series of text augmentation techniques are explored: gradual augmentation of the eight less represented classes and an uniform augmentation of the data set. Also, we study the impact of hashtags, user names, stopwords, and emojis as additional text features for the SVM model. The results of the experiments indicate that the SVM reacts negatively to all the data augmentation proposals, while the Deep Learning one shows small benefits from them. The best result of 52.92%, in weighted-average $$F_1$$score, is obtained by fine-tuning the Twitter roBERTa Base model without data augmentation.},

  abstract="Persuasion is a human activity of influence. In marketing, persuasion can help customers find solutions to their problems, make informed choices, or convince someone to buy a useful (or useless) product or service. In computer crimes, persuasion can trick users into revealing sensitive information, or even performing actions that benefit attackers. Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of persuasion-based attacks, as it exploits human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones. Therefore, an intelligent system capable of detecting and classifying persuasion attempts might be useful in protecting users. In this work, an approach that uses Machine Learning to analyze messages based on principles of persuasion and different data representations is presented. The aim of this research is to detect which data representation and which classification algorithm obtain the best results in detecting each principle of persuasion as a prior step to detecting phishing attacks. The results obtained indicate that among the combinations tested, there is one combination of data representation and classification algorithm that performs best. The related classification models obtained can detect the principles of persuasion at a rate that varies between 0.78 and 0.86 of AUC-ROC.",

  abstract="Text-based sentiment analysis is a popular application of artificial intelligence that has benefited in the past decade from the growth of digital social networks and its almost unlimited amount of data. Currently, social network users can combine different types of information in a single post, such as images, videos, GIFs, and live streams. As a result, they can express more complex thoughts and opinions. The goal of our study is to analyze the impact that incorporating different types of multimodal information may have on social media sentiment analysis. In particular, we give special attention to the interaction between text messages and images with and without text captions. To study this interaction we first create a new dataset in Spanish that contains tweets with images. Afterwards, we manually label several sentiments for each tweet, as follows: the overall tweet sentiment, the sentiment of the text, the sentiment of the individual images, the sentiment of the caption, if present, and---in cases where a single tweet has several images---the aggregate sentiment of all images present in the tweet. We conclude that incorporating visual information into text-based sentiment analysis raises the performance of the classifiers that determine the overall sentiment of a tweet by an average of 25.5{\%}.",
